// Package llama is an Arandu module: one entity, one policy that decides
// about it, one service that owns its Model-first data path, and the routes that
// reach them.
//
// The files are laid out by role rather than by layer, so the whole package
// reads top to bottom:
//
//	module.go      -> registration, routes, handlers and migrations
//	config.go      -> what the application passes in
//	model.go       -> the entity, and what it may answer with
//	policy.go      -> who may do what
//	service.go     -> the rules and Model access, after authorization
//	views.go       -> the files the application takes ownership of
//
// An application registers it explicitly. There is no service provider, no
// container and no discovery: the wiring is three lines somebody wrote, and
// reading them is how they learn what the application is made of.
