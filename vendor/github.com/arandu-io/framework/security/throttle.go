// The sign-in throttle, answered by github.com/arandu-io/hesape/auth.
//
// The counter that stops a leaked password list from being tried against an
// account belongs next to the decision it protects, which is why it went to
// auth and not to a route limiter.

// SignInThrottle counts sign-in attempts, so that a leaked password list cannot
// be tried against an account faster than a person can type.
//
// The unit is taken before the password is checked, in one indivisible step,
// and the two calls below give it back. Reading a counter and writing it back
// in two round trips reopens the hole this closes; the full argument is on
// hesape/auth.SignInThrottle.
//
// It stays declared here rather than aliasing hesape/auth.SignInThrottle,
// which added a context.Context as the first parameter of all three methods.
// An alias would change the shape every caller in the framework and in the
// thirteen repositories that import it is written against, and a bridge that
// changes a signature is not a bridge.
type SignInThrottle interface {
	// Attempt records one sign-in attempt against this identity from this
	// address and reports whether it may go ahead. A refused attempt costs
	// nothing, so hammering a locked-out account does not extend the lockout.

	// The tenant is part of the key: a rate limit shared across tenants is one
	// customer's traffic locking another customer's users out.
	Attempt(tenant, identity, client string) (retryAfter time.Duration, ok bool)

	// Refund gives back the unit Attempt took, for an attempt that never
	// reached the credential. It gives back one unit and never clears the
	// count, which is what keeps it from being the way out of a lockout.
	Refund(tenant, identity, client string)

	// Clear forgets what this identity failed from this address, and gives the
	// address back the unit this attempt took. Call it on a successful sign-in.
	//
	// The address's remaining count is deliberately left standing: one account
	// whose password the caller does know is exactly what a script walking a
	// stolen list has.

// implementation there.

// It is an envelope over hesape/auth.MemoryThrottle, which is the code that
// counts. What this adds is the context the old three methods do not take: the
// hesape implementation ignores it, because nothing in it blocks, so the one
// passed here is Background and the behaviour is unchanged.
