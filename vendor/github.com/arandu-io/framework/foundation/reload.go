// Live reload: the browser follows the restart, in development only.
//
// # This file is a copy, and the reason is visibility
//
// hesape/foundation/reload.go holds the same code, and this is not a second way
// to do one thing -- it is the same way, written twice, because the first copy
// is out of reach.
//
// That package exports exactly one symbol from the file, ReloadTagger, and this
// package aliases it. Everything the reload actually needs -- devReload,
// liveReload, htmlRecorder and its five methods, newBootID -- is unexported, and
// so is the whole of hesape/foundation/internal.go, which is where
// internalPrefix, exceptInternal and requireTracingSecret restated below come
// from. Go has no way to reach any of them from another module.
//
// The signature difference between []fhttp.Middleware and
// []pipeline.Middleware[http.Handler] is not the obstacle: those two are the
// same type, because fhttp.Middleware is an alias. The obstacle is the
// lower-case letter, and no aliasing removes it.
//
// The way out is for hesape/foundation to export what a kernel above it needs,
// and that is a change to a published module rather than a rewrite here. Until
// it happens the copy stays, with this note, so that nobody deletes it believing
// an alias will do.
//
// # Why it asks rather than listens
//
// This was an EventSource, and holding the connection open was the defect.
//
// HTTP/1.1 allows a browser six connections per origin, and a held stream
// spends one. On navigation the browser abandons the stream of the page it is
// leaving without closing it, and the server only notices when its next write
// fails -- up to the keepalive interval later. Six quick navigations left six
// dead streams holding every slot, and the seventh click did nothing at all
// until one of them timed out. Reported as "I navigate, I go back, I navigate,
// and it freezes", which is exactly what it was.
//
// Asking every second costs one connection for a millisecond and cannot
// accumulate. It also removed the keepalive ticker, the flush, the streaming
// content type, and the twenty seconds Shutdown used to spend waiting for a
// request that never ended.
//
// # Why the signal is the connection and not a message
//
// `aru dev` restarts the process on every change, so anything the old process
// knew is gone before it could announce anything. There is no moment at which a
// "reload now" message could be sent -- the sender is already dead.
//
// What survives is the browser's end of the connection. EventSource reconnects
// on its own, and the identity of what it reconnects TO is the whole signal:
// every process picks a random boot id at start, so an id that differs from the
// one the page loaded with means a different process is answering, which means
// the code changed. A dropped Wi-Fi connection reconnecting to the same process
// reports the same id and reloads nothing.
//
// That makes the mechanism a consequence of how `aru dev` already works rather
// than a protocol between two programs, which is the difference between one
// thing to keep working and two.
//
// # Why it is a middleware and not a tag in the layout
//
// A tag in the layout is a line every project has to carry, in a file people
// edit, that does nothing in production and looks like it should be deleted. The
// middleware mounts with the route, under the same IsDev, and a project that
// never heard of any of this gets it.
//
// It injects only into a document that has a </body>. An HTMX fragment does not,
// so a swap never receives a second EventSource -- which would otherwise
// accumulate one connection per interaction until the browser's six-per-origin
// limit closed the page down.
//
// # Why the script is a file and not inline
//
// The CSP is script-src 'self', and an inline <script> is refused by it -- the
// browser would drop the tag silently and the feature would appear simply not
// to work. So the script is registered as an ordinary asset and referenced by
// src, content-addressed like every other one. It costs one request, on a
// development server, once per page.
//
// # What is deliberately not here
//
// No CSS hot-swap, no state preservation, no module replacement. Those need a
// client-side runtime and a module graph, which is the JavaScript build this
// framework refuses. A full reload against a Go server that restarts in under a
// second is a fair trade, and it is one behaviour rather than two.

// reloadPath is where the browser listens. Under _arandu with health and the
// console, so one prefix covers everything the framework mounts.
const reloadPath = internalPrefix + "reload"

// bootID identifies this process to a page that was loaded by another one.
//
// Random rather than a timestamp or a pid: two processes started in the same
// second, or a pid the kernel recycled, would report the same identity and the
// page would never reload -- which is the one failure this cannot afford, since
// it is invisible and reads as the whole feature not working.
