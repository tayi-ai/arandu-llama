// It composes the components; it is not one of them, which is why it lives here

//
// Two bootstrappers run, and they are the whole of it:
//
//	LoadConfiguration  reads the environment, .env included, and answers every
//	                   component's settings
//	HandleExceptions   builds the handler that answers when something fails
//
// Loading the environment is not a bootstrapper of its own. Nothing here is
// evaluated -- the reading is direct, in LoadConfiguration -- so a second one
// would be a second way to load one file.
//
// Registering and booting modules are not bootstrappers either. There is no
// container and no provider: what an application composes is modules,
// explicitly, and the two halves of that are Application.Register and
// Application.Boot. They are methods rather than bootstrappers because the list
// of modules is written by hand in bootstrap/app.go, where it can be read.
