// puts the messages in the browser, this takes them out again, and view.New
// copies them onto the Page every screen already embeds. The handler in between
// passes nothing, which is the point -- the failure being fixed is a message that
// existed and did not reach the screen, and every hand-written hop is another
// place for it to stop.
//
// The kernel installs it. It is not in the application's pipeline because there
// is nothing to decide about it: a pipeline entry an application can leave out is
// one an application leaves out, and the symptom is a form that comes back blank
// -- indistinguishable from having no flash at all.
