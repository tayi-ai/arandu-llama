// SignInPath is where a guard sends somebody who has to sign in.
//
// Fixed, for the reason security.SessionCookieName is fixed: it is the address
// the framework's auth module registers and the address the starter kit answers
// at, and a configurable one buys nothing while giving two parts of a project a
// way to disagree about where the sign-in screen is.
//
// It is also the pattern that module registers the screen under, and the screen
// carries the name "auth.login" -- so a path built from that name is this
// string, by construction rather than by two declarations that happen to agree.
// Which of the two to reach for is decided by what the caller holds: a guard
// runs before any route has matched and has no table to ask, so it uses this;
// anything holding a route table asks it for "auth.login" and gets the same
// answer.
//
// The address somebody is sent to when they are ALREADY signed in is a
// parameter, because that one genuinely differs -- a blog sends them to the
// front page, an application to its dashboard.
const SignInPath = "/auth/login"

// PasswordConfirmPath is where RequireConfirmedPassword sends somebody who has a
// session but has not typed their password recently.
//
// Fixed for the same reason SignInPath is: it is the address the starter kit
// registers for that screen, and two parts of a project that disagree about it
// produce a guard which redirects to a 404.
const PasswordConfirmPath = "/auth/password/confirm"

// The route guards, and the line they must not cross.
//
// A guard answers two questions and no others: is there a session, and does the
// subject carry this role. It decides NOTHING about a record. Whether this
// subject may read or write THIS row is the Policy's answer, and the Policy
// still runs -- every handler behind a guard still goes through its service and
// therefore through security.Grant, on the write path and on the read path
// alike.
//
// That line is what keeps security.Grant the one authorization path. A guard
// that starts deciding about records is a second one, and with two of them the
// one that gets forgotten is always the guard: a Policy is written once per
// entity and reached from everywhere, while a guard is mounted per route and
// the route somebody adds next month has none. The examples project says the
// same thing about its own adminOnly, in routes/admin.go, and it is worth
// repeating here because this is the file somebody reaches for when a Policy
// feels like too much work.

// RequireAuth refuses a request that carries no session.
//
// It sends the visitor to SignInPath rather than answering 403, because there
// is nothing they can do with a 403 and there is something they can do with the
// sign-in screen.
//
// It remembers where they were going first. This is the only place that knows:
// by the time a password has been typed, the request that was refused is gone,
// and a sign-in that always ends at the front page makes somebody who followed a
// link to one invoice go and find it again. The address goes in a signed cookie
// rather than in the session, because the session is the thing that does not
// exist yet at the moment the guard fires -- see SessionStore.RememberIntended,
// and SessionStore.TakeIntended for the other end of it.

// of the two it is always the guard that gets forgotten: a Policy is written once
// per entity and reached from everywhere, a guard is mounted per route and the
// route somebody adds next month has none.
//
// So this is a freshness check on the session, not permission. "Recently
// confirmed" and "allowed" are different facts, and an application that used
// this in place of a Policy would let a confirmed subject reach every record in
// its tenant.
