// StatusCSRFExpired is the status returned when the token is missing, invalid or
// expired. 419 is the conventional status for it, kept on purpose: HTMX can be told to
// reload the page on 419, which is the only useful reaction to an expired token.
const StatusCSRFExpired = 419

// CSRFProtect refuses a state-changing request the browser reports as
// cross-origin, then validates the token on the ones that are left.
//
// THE TRAP THIS SOLVES: with HTMX the token does not always arrive in a form
// field, it arrives in a header. Both sources are read, the X-CSRF-Token header
// first and the _token form field after it.
//
// The field is named for the session key the token is stored under, which is
// the one name a form builder, a view and this middleware can all arrive at
// without agreeing on a second one first. A field spelled any other way is read
// by nothing here and the request is refused as though it carried no token.
//
// A form carries the hidden _token field, so a submission is covered whether it
// posts natively or through hx-post. What that does not cover is a request no
// form backs -- hx-delete on a button, hx-patch on a toggle. Those carry the
// token only where the markup puts it, either once on the layout
//
//	<body hx-headers='{"X-CSRF-Token": "{{ .CSRFToken }}"}'>
//
// or on the element that sends the request.
//
// Nothing verifies that the line is there. A layout that loses it keeps
// rendering and every form goes on working; the first button that deletes
// something answers StatusCSRFExpired instead, which reads as an expired
// session rather than as missing markup.
//
// The two checks answer different failures and neither replaces the other. The
// origin check reads Sec-Fetch-Site, which browsers have sent since 2023, and
// falls back to comparing Origin against Host; it costs no allocation and turns
// a form posted from another site away before any HMAC is computed. It cannot
// stand alone, because a request carrying neither header is allowed -- that is
// how a non-browser client reaches an application at all. The token is what
// covers those, and it is the layer that survives a browser too old to report
// where the request came from.
//
// A cross-origin refusal is 403 rather than StatusCSRFExpired, because the two
// ask different things of whoever hit them. An expired token is fixed by
// reloading the page, which brings a fresh one; an origin is not, and telling
// the browser to reload would send it round the same refusal again.
//
// There is no list of trusted origins to configure. A state-changing request
// from another site is exactly what this refuses, so an exception to it is a
// decision about an application rather than a setting on a middleware.
//
// sessionIDFrom must return the id only for a valid session cookie -- pass
// SessionStore.IDFromRequest, which verifies the signature first.

			//
			// Both answers go through fhttp.Refuse rather than http.Error, and

			// http.Error the message reaches a person as nothing at all -- they

			// one of the two would leave the framework refusing an HTMX request
			// in two different ways.
