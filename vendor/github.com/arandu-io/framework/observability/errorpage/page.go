// RenderDump goes through Recover, which is the only caller of the dump page

// Render draws the full error page.
//
// It is hesape/exception's debug displayer, which is the exported door to the

// through here:
//
//   - The status is the failure's answer rather than a fixed 500. A panic
//     nothing classifies is still 500; one carrying a status -- an Abort, or one
//     of the sentinels hesape knows -- is now drawn with that status instead of
//     being reported to the client as an internal error.
//   - The stack has three more collapsed frames on top: this function, the
//     deferred recover that called it, and runtime.gopanic. hesape captures
//     inside the displayer, which is one hop further out than the old capture
//     from inside this function. The line that panicked is still on the stack
//     and still the first expanded frame.
//   - A panic value that is not an error is wrapped, so the subtitle -- the Go
//     type of what failed -- reads as the wrapper rather than as the original.
//     The headline and the message are unchanged, because both are built from
//     the text. hesape has no exported entry that takes the raw value.

//
// hesape draws the page from an error, and a panic in Go is any value at all.

// thing the wrapper costs.

// The dump page is drawn by an unexported method whose one caller is Recover,
// on the branch that recognises the dump-and-die sentinel. So this is Recover,
// handed a handler that raises that sentinel: hesape catches it, sees
// development, and draws the page. It is indirect and it is the whole of the
// exported surface that reaches this page -- see the note in the report.
//
// Two details keep it honest. The sentinel is unexported in hesape/log and
// DumpDie is the only door to it, so DumpDie is what raises it; the context
// passed carries no Collector, so its recording half does nothing and no
// phantom entry is added to the page the caller is about to see. And Recover
// answers the dump page before it logs anything, so nothing is written to the
// log that the old path did not write.
