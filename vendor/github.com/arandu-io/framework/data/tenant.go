// The tenant, answered by github.com/arandu-io/hesape/auth.

// It is the one symbol in this package that did not go to hesape/database, and
// the move is the point: reading a tenant is reading one field off a Grant, and
// it lived in the SQL package, so the cache, the filesystem and the scheduler
// all had to import the database to prefix a key with the customer it belongs
// to.
