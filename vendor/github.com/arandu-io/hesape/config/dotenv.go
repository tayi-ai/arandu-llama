// envFile is the file [Load] reads before it reads the environment.
//
// One name, and it is not configurable. There is no --env-file flag and no
// variable that moves it: a second place to put configuration is a second
// place to look for it when the wrong value is in effect.
const envFile = ".env"

// LoadDotenv fills the gaps in the process environment from./.env.
//
// [Load] calls it, and calling it directly is for the one case Load does not
// cover: a program that reads the environment without building an [App], such
// as a CLI command that only needs a connection string.
//
// # Why it exists
//
// `aru new crm` writes a.env with a fresh APP_KEY and then prints "cd crm &&
// aru migrate". Nothing read that file, so the first command of every new
// project died with "APP_KEY must be 32 bytes, got 0 (run `aru key:generate`)"
// -- telling the reader to generate the key that was already on disk.
//
// # Precedence, which is the part that matters
//
// A variable that is already defined in the environment always wins; the file
// only fills what is missing. That is what keeps production intact: the
// orchestrator sets the real values, and a.env that got copied into an image
// by accident cannot override them. Never invert this.
//
// "Already defined" means present, not non-empty. A deployment that exports a
// variable as the empty string has made a decision, and a file on disk does not
// get to overrule it.
//
// # The format is closed
//
// KEY=value, blank lines, whole-line comments starting with #, an optional
// `export ` prefix, and optional single or double quotes wrapping the value.
// That is all of it. No ${INTERPOLATION}, no multi-line values, no include, no
// inline comment after a value -- a # in a password is a # in a password. A
// line the format does not cover is an error naming the file and the line
// rather than a variable that silently did not arrive.
//
// A missing file is not an error. That is production: the environment is
// already populated and there is no file at all.
