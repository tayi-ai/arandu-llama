	// Five is chosen from the human side of the form. Somebody who is not sure
	// which of their three passwords this application knows needs three or four
	// tries; nobody needs a sixth inside the same minute. On the other side, it
	// turns an online guessing run against one account into five guesses a
	// minute, which is not an attack -- it is a rounding error against any
	// password worth the name.
	MaxSignInFailures = 5

	// MaxSignInFailuresPerClient is the budget of one address across every
	// identity it names, and it is what makes the constant above mean anything.
	//
	// Keyed only by identity and address, a leaked address list is still five
	// free guesses per account and the whole list gets walked. Worse, every
	// address typed opens a counter, so a script naming a million of them is a
	// million live entries -- the counter meant to stop an attack becomes the
	// way to exhaust the process.
	//
	// Five accounts' worth, and it is a cap on *this address*, so it is only as
	// narrow as RemoteAddr is specific. Behind a proxy that does not rewrite
	// RemoteAddr every request in the world shares one budget, and then this
	// constant is a cap on the whole application's sign-in form -- twenty-five
	// wrong passwords a minute across every customer. That deployment has to be
	// fixed at the proxy.
	MaxSignInFailuresPerClient = 5 * MaxSignInFailures

	// SignInWindow is how long a spent budget stays spent. A minute, because
	// the point is to make guessing slow rather than to punish: the person who
	// mistyped their password five times gets in a minute later without writing
	// to support.
	//
	// It is a fixed window and not a sliding one, so the honest number is up to
	// ten guesses across a boundary -- five in the last instant of one window
	// and five in the first instant of the next -- and five a minute after that.
	// The same arithmetic as the route limiter, kept deliberately: a second,
	// cleverer notion of "window" in the same framework is a second thing to
	// maintain, and doubling five is not what makes an online guessing run work.

// SignInThrottle counts sign-in attempts, so that a leaked password list cannot
// be tried against an account faster than a person can type.
//
// # The unit is taken before the password is checked
//
// This is the whole shape of the thing, and the first version got it wrong. It
// asked whether the account was locked out and recorded the failure afterwards,
// with an argon2 hash in between -- and between the question and the answer
// there is a tenth of a second in which nothing has been written down. Eight
// requests fired at the same instant all asked, all got "no", and all eight had
// their passwords checked: the budget was five and the burst got eight, and with
// a few hundred open sockets it would have got a few hundred. A counter that
// only counts attempts arriving one after another does not limit an attacker,
// who has no reason to wait for the previous answer.
//
// So Attempt takes the unit at the moment it decides, in one indivisible step,
// and the two calls below give it back. A successful sign-in forgets the
// identity's failures entirely; an attempt that never got as far as testing a
// credential gives back exactly what it took. What is left counted is what was
// actually tried and actually wrong.
//
// An implementation that reads a counter and writes it back in two round trips
// has reopened the hole, and over a network it is wider than it was in process,
// because the gap between the two is a network away rather than a mutex away.
// Whatever holds the counters has to decide and record as one operation.
//
// # Why this is not a route limiter
//
// Not for want of the other two calls: the route limiter can give an attempt
// back, and it can forget a key. It is the shape of a sign-in attempt that does
// not fit. The key is three values -- tenant, identity and client -- and one
// attempt spends TWO budgets in the same instant: what this identity has left
// from this address, and what this address has left across every identity it
// names. Both have to be read and both written as one indivisible step, or a
// burst sees room in both and gets through both. Against a limiter keyed by one
// string that is two calls, which is two steps. And the tenant has nowhere to
// go: that key is deliberately not one, because a route limit runs before
// authentication on the routes where it matters most.
//
// So: a second interface, and deliberately not a second mechanism. The
// in-memory implementation below is what the core ships; a Redis-backed one has
// this same shape, which is what makes it an adapter rather than a mode. The
// context is on all three methods for that implementation's sake -- it is the
// one that talks over a socket, and a sign-in form that cannot give up on a
// wedged counter is a sign-in form that hangs.
