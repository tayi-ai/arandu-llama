// Config describes one connection.
//
// It comes from ONE variable, and that is the whole of the design:
//
//	DATABASE_URL=postgres://arandu:arandu@127.0.0.1:5432/arandu?sslmode=disable
//	DATABASE_URL=mysql://arandu:arandu@127.0.0.1:3306/arandu
//	DATABASE_URL=sqlite://database/database.sqlite
//
// There is no second set of variables -- no DB_HOST, no DB_PORT, no
// DB_DATABASE -- because two ways to say where the database is produces the
// worst kind of failure: half the parts overridden and half not, an application
// pointing at a host from one variable and a database from another, with every
// value individually correct.
//
// One string also travels. Every managed platform hands out exactly this, a
// compose file passes it as one line, and a person moving between them copies
// one thing instead of six.
//
// It lives here rather than in hesape/config because the reader of DATABASE_URL
// and the opener of the connection are one decision, and splitting them puts an
// import from the configuration package into the SQL package, pointing the wrong
// way.
//
// The connection fields below are what the URL parsed into. They are read,
// never written: what wrote them is ParseURL, in one place, with one set of
// rules. The three pool fields are the exception and are documented as such --
// ParseURL never touches them, because how many connections to hold is not part
// of where the database is.
type Config struct {
	Connection Dialect
	Database   string // file path for SQLite, database name otherwise
	Host       string

	// MaxOpenConns caps the connections in flight. Zero is 25.
	//
	// Zero on this field and the two below means the default of this package,
	// and never database/sql's meaning for zero, which is unbounded. That
	// difference is the whole rule: ParseURL leaves all three at zero, so every
	// configuration built from a URL -- which is every configuration there is --
	// carries zero. Reading it as database/sql does would take the bound off
	// every pool at once, and the bound is the reason [Open] sets these at all:
	// an unbounded pool turns one traffic spike into "too many connections" on
	// the server instead of a queue in this process.
	//
	// There is therefore no way to ask for an unbounded pool, deliberately. The
	// answer to a pool that is too small is a larger number, and the answer to
	// one that is too small at every number is a queue.
	//
	// SQLite ignores this one: it gets a single writer whatever is set here.
	// See [Open].
	MaxOpenConns int

	// MaxIdleConns is how many connections stay open between queries. Zero is 5.
	//
	// database/sql caps it at MaxOpenConns on its own, so a number above the
	// open limit is the open limit.
	MaxIdleConns int

	// ConnMaxLifetime retires a connection after this long. Zero is one hour.
	//
	// A managed database that rotates behind a proxy hands out connections that
	// stop working, and a lifetime is what makes the pool replace them without a
	// request failing first.
