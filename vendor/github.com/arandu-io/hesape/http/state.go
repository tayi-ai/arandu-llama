// State is what the framework knows about a request before the handler runs.
//
// Today it is one thing: what the request that redirected here failed on. It is
// a struct rather than that one thing so the next piece of per-request framework
// state -- there will be one -- does not add a second context key, a second
// middleware and a second accessor that every page has to be taught about.
//
// It is put on the request context by the middleware that spends the flash
// cookie, in hesape/session, and read by view.New. Nothing else writes it, and
// no handler ever has to: a handler that had to carry the errors from the
// middleware to the page would be a handler that can forget to, and forgetting
// is invisible -- the form comes back blank, exactly as it did before any of
// this existed.

	// for those fields survive when their values do not.
