// Reject answers a request whose input failed the rules: back where it came
// from, with the messages and with what was typed still in the boxes.
//
// It composes what answering a rejected form needs: a redirect back to
// where the request came from, carrying the input that was typed and the
// validation messages, so the page that follows the redirect can show them.
// The shape is deliberate: the answer to a rejected form is a redirect, not
// a body. A body was tried first and is the failure that produced this
// file. A 422 carrying the messages in the markup is thrown away by htmx
// unless the layout has reconfigured its response handling, so the person
// saw the form they submitted, unchanged, with nothing on it; and even
// where it was swapped in, a reload re-posted the form. A redirect is read
// by every client there is, and the page that follows it is a page.
//
// # Why it takes the flash rather than reaching for one
//
// RedirectResponse's WithInput and WithErrors need a session, and this
// package requires hesape/session for exactly that reason -- the dependency
// runs Http -> Session and never back. The Flash is a parameter and not a
// package-level default because a process serving two applications has two
// keys.
//
// # What "back" means, and why it is checked
//
// The Referer, and "/" when there is none or it is not ours. That address ends
// up in a Location header, so it is chosen by whoever sent the request:
// "https://evil.example/login" is a Referer somebody can send, and answering it
// turns every form in the application into an open redirect. [LocalPath] is the
// check, and it is the same one the intended-destination cookie has used since
// it existed -- one definition of "is this address ours", carrying its four
// documented bypasses, rather than a second one written here that knows about
// three of them.
//
// # What goes in the flash
//
// The posted form, minus the fields session.Flash never carries back, and the
// messages. The query string is deliberately not included: it is already in the
// address being returned to, and adding it would put the same values on the page
// twice with a chance of the two disagreeing.
func Reject(w stdhttp.ResponseWriter, r *stdhttp.Request, f *session.Flash, errs validation.Errors) {
	if f != nil {
		// Parsed here rather than assumed: a handler that rejected on the first
		// rule may never have read the body, and the whole value of what was
		// typed is that it goes back in the boxes. ParseForm is a no-op when the
		// form has already been read.
		_ = r.ParseForm()
		f.Write(w, errs, r.PostForm)

	// A rejected form is one person's typed input coming back to them. It must

	// answers. See Redirect.

}

// Back is the address a rejected request is sent to: where it came from, or
// "/".
//
// Exported because a handler that answers a rejection itself -- one that has
// a domain reason rather than a rule failure -- needs the same address, and
// a second reading of the Referer header is a second place for the
// open-redirect check to be missing.
//
// It answers "/" for everything it cannot prove is ours: no Referer, an
// unparseable one, one on another host, or a path [LocalPath] refuses. Landing
// on the front page is a bad answer; landing on somebody else's site carrying
// the fact that you just submitted a form is a worse one.
