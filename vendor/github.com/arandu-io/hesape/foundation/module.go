// Module is the only unit of composition in the framework.
//
// A module is a directory. It registers its own routes, its own migrations and
// its own dependency graph. There is no injection container and no reflection
// based resolution: the wiring is explicit, and the CLI generates the file that
// instantiates everything.
//
// Every third-party module implements this interface and nothing else. It is
// the public contract of the framework -- change it and the whole ecosystem
// breaks, so change it with great care.
//
// What this interface names is a vertical slice: a directory with its routes,
// its migrations, its policies and its repository, composed by hand in
// bootstrap/app.go.
//
// Everything below is optional and independent of Module: a module implements
// as many of these as it has reasons to, and a module that implements none of
// them is still a module.
type Module interface {
	// Name is the stable identifier of the module: a lowercase slug, no spaces.
	//
	// It is what `aru routes` prints beside a route, what the route names are
	// prefixed with, and what a diagnosis is attributed to. Stable means a
	// rename is a new module rather than the same one under another name: the
	// route names built from it are in published links and in tests.
	Name() string

	// Routes registers the module's HTTP routes.
	//
	// The routes are code rather than a file the framework loads: the router is
	// handed in, so nothing is registered on a global and there is nothing to
	// reset between tests.
	//
	// A module with no HTTP surface -- a relay, a scheduler-only module -- still
	// implements it and returns having registered nothing. An empty
	// implementation is one line, and an optional interface for the absence of
	// routes would be a second shape to check for what a no-op already says.
	Routes(r *routing.Router)

// Bootable is optional: implement it when the module needs to prepare state at
// boot -- open a pool, warm a cache, register codecs.
//
// Boot wires; it does not run. A module that needs a loop of its own implements
// [Background] instead, and validates in Boot whatever would make that loop
// fail.

// Background is optional: the module runs a loop of its own -- the scheduler
// and the outbox relay do.
//
// Start is called by Run, never by Boot, and that distinction is the difference
// between a process that serves and a process that does something else. Every
// command boots. The worker command is `aru queue:work`. The same is true of
// `aru routes`, `aru schedule:list` and `aru migrate`. Starting the loops at
// boot meant every worker replica also ran a scheduler and a relay. That meant
// `aru schedule:run`, which exists to run one task by hand, also started the
// loop that runs all of them. Found by audit.
//
// One process, one job. The lock in the scheduler makes the duplicate harmless
// rather than correct, and "harmless because something else catches it" is not
// a design.

// Diagnostic is optional: the module reports what it knows about the state of
// the system, in sentences a person can act on.
//
// It feeds the error page. The most useful hint is often about something that
// happened outside the failing request -- the outbox stuck for four minutes, a
// job that has not run -- and a page that only looks at the request cannot see
// any of it.
//
// Return nothing when there is nothing wrong. A diagnosis that always says
// something is a diagnosis nobody reads.
