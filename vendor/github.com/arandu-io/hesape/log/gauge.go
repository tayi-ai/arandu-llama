// GaugeName identifies one reading: what is measured, and whose it is.

// has to be taken apart again to answer "every tenant this metric was set for",
// and a metric or a tenant that contains the separator makes that answer wrong.

	// Metric is what is being measured. The registry never interprets it: the
	// caller that sets a name is the one that knows what it counts.

// was there is gone: no history, no window, no peak, no average and no rate. A
// reader gets what is true now, and there is nothing to expire, sample or page
// through.
//
// This is what the Collector and the Recorder are not. Both of those are scoped
// to one request and drop what they hold when it ends, so a number that belongs
// to the process rather than to a request fits in neither.
//
// The registry stores; it does not measure. Whatever keeps the number is what
// writes it here, and it is that writer, not this type, that knows what the
// number means.
