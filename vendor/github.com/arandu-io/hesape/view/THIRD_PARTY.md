# Third-party notices

Arandu is MIT licensed (see `LICENSE.md`). This file covers the third-party
work that is **embedded** in `view/assets/` and therefore redistributed inside
every binary built with this framework — including binaries built by people who
never downloaded any of it.

That is what makes this file necessary rather than polite. `go:embed` puts these
bytes in the executable, so every user of Arandu becomes a redistributor, and a
redistributor of MIT-licensed code owes the copyright notice. There is no CDN
and no `node_modules` to point at instead (RULE 13): the notice has to travel
with the repository.

Keeping it current is checked, not remembered: `TestEveryEmbeddedAssetIsCredited`
in `view/third_party_test.go` fails when a file appears in `view/assets/`
without an entry here, and when the version recorded here stops matching the
version inside the file.

## htmx — `view/assets/htmx.min.js`

| | |
|---|---|
| Version | 2.0.4 |
| Author | Big Sky Software |
| Home | https://htmx.org |
| License | Zero-Clause BSD (0BSD) |

0BSD asks for no notice at all — it is the one license here that does not
require this section. It is recorded anyway, because a list that documents only
what is compulsory does not tell a reader what is in the binary.

## Tailwind CSS — `view/assets/app.css`

| | |
|---|---|
| Version | 4.3.3 |
| Author | Tailwind Labs, Inc. |
| Home | https://tailwindcss.com |
| License | MIT |

`app.css` is compiled output, not a copy of the distribution: the Arandu source
in `view/assets/app.src.css` goes through the standalone `tailwindcss` binary,
and what comes out contains Tailwind's own preflight and utility declarations.
The compiler preserves its banner at the top of the file, which is the version
recorded above:

```
/*! tailwindcss v4.3.3 | MIT License | https://tailwindcss.com */
```

## Basecoat — `view/assets/basecoat.bundle.js`

| | |
|---|---|
| Version | 1.0.2 |
| Author | Ronan Berder |
| Home | https://basecoatui.com |
| License | MIT |

The bundle is the concatenation of seven of the component scripts upstream
ships: the registry the others register into, plus the dropdown menu, the
popover, the select, the sidebar, the tabs and the toast. Each is a plain IIFE
with no import and no export, so concatenating them is the whole build.

Its stylesheet is **not** here. That ships with the project rather than with the
framework, vendored under `resources/css/basecoat/`, with this same licence
beside it -- a project owns its design system, and changing how a button looks
should be editing a file you can see rather than upgrading a dependency.

## Arandu's own files

Listed so that every file in `view/assets/` is accounted for, and so that
adding one is a decision somebody wrote down rather than an omission.

- `view/assets/theme.js` — Arandu, MIT, covered by `LICENSE.md`. It reads the
  theme somebody chose out of localStorage and applies it before the first
  paint. It contains no third-party code.
- `view/assets/ui.js` — Arandu, MIT, covered by `LICENSE.md`. It is the
  delegated client behaviour: copy buttons, the theme toggle, the combobox, the
  command palette and the range slider, all dispatched from `data-*` attributes
  read as data. It contains no third-party code, and it is why no directive
  framework is embedded here — compiling an attribute into a function needs
  `unsafe-eval`, and the Content-Security-Policy this framework sets is
  `script-src 'self'`.
- `view/assets/app.src.css` — Arandu, MIT, covered by `LICENSE.md`. It is the
  Tailwind input this project wrote; it contains no third-party code, only
  `@import "tailwindcss"`, which is a build instruction.
