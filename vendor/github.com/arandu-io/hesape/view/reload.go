// The development live-reload script.
//
// It lives here and not in the kernel because it is an asset and a tag, which is
// what this package is for -- and because the kernel cannot reach this package
// at all: view imports kernel to be a Module, so the arrow only points one way.
// The kernel asks for it through an optional interface and supplies the address
// of the stream, which is the one thing it owns.
//
// Why it is a file rather than an inline <script>: the CSP is script-src
// 'self'. An inline tag is refused by it -- silently, which would read as the
// feature simply not working -- so this is registered like every other asset
// and referenced by its content-addressed URL.

// reloadAsset is the file name the script is served under.

// ReloadTag registers the reload script and returns the tag that runs it.
//
// stream is where the script listens, and it comes from the caller because the
// route belongs to the kernel: two constants for one address is how a client and
// a server come to disagree about it.
//
// Registering happens once. A second call returns the same tag rather than
// panicking on a duplicate asset, so a test that boots two kernels is not a
// crash.

// The whole signal is which process answers: every process picks a random
// identity at boot, and one different from the identity this page loaded with
// means the code changed.
//
// It ASKS rather than listening, and that is the fix for the defect that sent
// this back to be rewritten -- see the header of hesape/foundation/reload.go. A
// held connection spends one of the browser's six per origin and is not
// released when you navigate away, so a handful of clicks froze the site.
//
// Three things make asking cheap enough to be the right answer:
//
//   - It does not ask while you are not looking. document.hidden is true for a
//     background tab, a minimised window and another desktop, and a project
//     left open in a tab for a day would otherwise be eighty thousand requests
//     nobody wanted.
//   - It asks the moment you come back, before the next tick, so returning to
//     the tab is not a wait. That is the case the interval alone gets wrong.
//   - A failed request is the server restarting, which is the most likely
//     moment for one. It is ignored rather than retried faster: the next tick
//     is a second away and the answer will keep until then.
