// Signer issues links that prove something without storing anything.
//
// It is what an e-mail verification link is made of, and what an unsubscribe
// link should be made of. The alternative -- a table of tokens -- costs a write,
// a read, a cleanup job and a decision about what happens when the row is gone;
// this costs a signature, and a link that has expired says so rather than saying
// "unknown token" three months after the row was deleted.
//
// Two properties are what make it safe to put in a URL:
//
//   - The purpose is signed. A token issued to verify an address does not work
//     on a password reset, even though both are signed with the same key. Reusing
//     one for the other is the mistake this prevents, and it is not an unlikely
//     one: both are "a link in an e-mail with an id in it".
//   - The expiry is signed. Moving it is changing the payload, so a link that
//     has run out cannot be extended by editing the URL.
//
// What it deliberately does NOT do is make the link single-use. That needs
// state, and where single use matters -- a password reset -- the state is the
// password itself: the token carries the current hash, so using the link
// changes what it was signed against.

// in stays a window onto the caller's memory, and a caller that zeroes or
// reuses that buffer would silently change what the application signs. One key,
// one package, one rule about who owns the bytes.
