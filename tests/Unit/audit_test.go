// What this package proves about itself, before anybody installs it.
//
// `aru doctor` audits the application it is run inside. It walks that project's
// own tree, skips vendor/, reads the one arandu.mod.toml at its root, and
// refuses a directory that is not an application at all. It never loads a
// dependency. So nothing an installed package does is audited by the
// application that installed it: a package that reached a table without a
// Grant, took a tenant out of a request, or declared no capabilities and then
// opened a socket would pass every check the installer runs.
//
// The package is therefore the only place that check can happen, and this is
// it. These tests read this package's own Go files as syntax and hold four
// properties:
//
//  1. every exported Service method calls Authorize before it reaches the
//     configured Model;
//  2. the tenant comes from the Grant, and nothing a request carried is read as
//     one;
//  3. the Model remains tenant-scoped and CRUD does not grow a second data path;
//  4. what arandu.mod.toml declares is what the code does.
//
// The fifth is held where the routes exist rather than here, because a prefix
// arrives through configuration and syntax cannot follow it:
// TestNoRouteLandsInTheFrameworkNamespace, in tests/Feature/routes_test.go,
// registers the module and reads the table back.
//
// What these tests do not reach is worth as much as what they do. They read
// syntax: a call hidden behind an interface, a wrapper around the named Model
// entry point, and anything reached by reflection are all invisible to them. A
// green run means no such thing was found written down, not that none exists.
// What is absolute is what the compiler holds alongside them -- a Model terminal
// with no Grant in its call does not compile.

// buildable reports whether the compiler ever reads this file.
//
// It asks the build constraint rather than the file name, so a file excluded by
// a tag is left out of the audit whatever it is called: what the compiler never
// builds is not part of what the package does, and reporting it as such would
// be reporting a capability nobody can reach.
